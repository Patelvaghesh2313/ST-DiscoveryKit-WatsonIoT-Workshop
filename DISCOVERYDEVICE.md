# Registering a new device to the Watson IoT Platform

## Lab Objectives

This Lab will show you how to register your ST Micro Discovery Kit IoT Node with the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform.  In the lab you will learn:

- How to define a device type and register a device in the Watson IoT Platform

### Introduction

Before you can connect a device to the Watson IoT Platform you need to define how the device will connect to the platform and also register the device to generate an access token for the device.  This will be used to verify the device identity.

You need to decide how you want to group devices, by function, by hardware type, etc.  Each device registered on the platform must be registered against a device type.  There are no restrictions about how devices are grouped and the device types, for this workshop we will create a device type representing the ST Microelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node devices.

###Â Step 1 - Add a new device type for Discovery Kit IoT Node device

- Navigate into the Devices section (1) of the console
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-Devices.png)

- Select the **Device Types** section (2).  Press the **+ Add Device Type** (3) button
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceType.png)

- Enter the following:
  - Type : Ensure **Device** is selected (NOT Gateway)
  - Name : Enter **DiscoveryKit** (4)
- Press the **Next** button (5)
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceType-Create.png)

- Press the **Done** button (6)
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceType-Done.png)

### Step 2 - Register a new Discovery Kit device in the IoT Platform

You now have the opportunity to register a device.
- Press **Register Device** (7)
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceRegister.png)

- The DiscoveryKit device type should be pre-selected.  You now need to enter a unique device ID.  You can choose how you want to identify devices.  For the workshop, use a simple format, such as **IoTNode1**. (8)
- Press **Next** button (9)
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceName.png)

- Press **Next** button (10)
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceInfo.png)
- You will be prompted to provide a token (11).

- Each time you connect the device the token will need to be presented to the server. Once the device is registered there is no way to recover a token. You will need to delete and reregister the device if the token is lost or forgotten.

- Enter a **token** for your device (11) then press **Next** (12). *Warning:* Do not select an auth token with the word **Token**
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceToken.png)

- You will see a summary of the device.  Press **Done** to complete the device registration.
![Create DiscoveryKit Device](screenshots/IoTP-DeviceSummary.png)

- You are now shown a **Device Credentials** page - this is the last chance you get to see the token.  Once you leave this page the token can not be recovered. Write down the Org, Device Type, Device ID and Authentication Token. You might even consider taking a screen shot.

### Step 3 - Reprogram the ST Microelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node
Instead of sending the ST Microelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node sensor data to Quickstart, we can now reprogram the board to send data to your secure Watson IoT Platform instance.  If you have not yet powered the ST Microelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node, connect it to your laptop using a MicroUSB cable.  Start the terminal program to access the program running on the ST Microelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node.

- Press the **Black Reset** on the ST Microelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node
- Let it reconnect to the WiFi network
- When the program prompts, Enter **y** to update the device credentials
```
Do you want to update your way to register, or the device credentials? (y/n)
```

- When the program prompts, Enter **2** to specify a simple registered device.
```
Enter Registration Mode (1 - Quickstart, 2 - Simple):
```

- The program then prompts for your Org, DeviceType, DeviceId and Auth Token.  You might want to type the string into a text editor to avoid typos and mistakes, then copy / paste the string into the program as hidden text.  In the example case:
```
OrgId=spzdfr;DeviceType=DiscoveryKit;DeviceId=IoTNode1;Token=MySecret
```

- The program will connect via MQTT to Watson IoT Platform.
- To send data, press the Blue **user** button. The application publishes the current sensor values.
- On double button push, the application enters in a loop and publishes sensor values automatically every second.
- For comparison, a full execution of the program is included below:
