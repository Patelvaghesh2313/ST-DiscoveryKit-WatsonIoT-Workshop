# ST-DiscoveryKit-WatsonIoT-Workshop
STMicroelectronics Discovery Kit IoT Node and IBM Watson Hands-On Workshop

## ST Discovery Kit IoT Node and IBM Watson Hands-On Workshop:
Learn how to connect your next IoT design to the Cloud using IBM Watson IoT Platform and the ST Discovery Kit IoT node.  The IoT Discovery Kit features an ultra-low-power STM32L4 Cortex® -M4 MCU, wireless connectivity and an array of sensors to showcase cloud connectivity features.
Presenters: STMicroelectronics team with John Walicki, IBM

This hands-on workshop will show you how to integrate sensors, wireless connectivity (WiFi, NFC, BLE, SubGHz), a low-power microcontroller and sensor libraries into your next IoT design. You’ll then learn to connect the Discovery Kit to IBM Cloud and Watson IoT Platform to create a new application in minutes using Node-RED.

The hands-on training is a working session – please bring your laptop. Note: Administrator rights is needed for software and driver installation. ST will provide the required STM32 development boards and software. SPACE IS LIMITED FOR THIS SESSION – FIRST COME, FIRST SEATED. Must be present and stay for training to receive free kit.
